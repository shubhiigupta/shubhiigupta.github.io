  Hi! My nameâ€™s Shubhi and I am a computer science undergraduate at SRM Institute of Science and Technology, studying image processing, statistics and neural networks, striving to develop fun and friendly solutions in automation.

  Aided with my hyperactive imagination, I spend quality time in digital and 3D art and take quite the delight in conducing my version of the cities from the 31st century and sometimes even ramen bowls.

  I am personally attached to the quote - <mark>"Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back."</mark>
